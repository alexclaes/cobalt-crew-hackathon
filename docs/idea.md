# Project Idea

The app automatically creates weekend or short‑stay trips by allowing users to input multiple starting locations, calculating a central meeting point within a 50 km radius, and suggesting nearby cities. 

It offers tailored activity recommendations (accommodation, dining, wellness, culture, sports) based on user‑defined focus and budget, while integrating calendar data to find a suitable travel window for all participants. 

A preview with a map and shareable deeplink lets everyone see the finalized itinerary at a glance.
